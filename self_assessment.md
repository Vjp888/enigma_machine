Self Assessment

Funtionality - 3
  I feel that I have completed the required function. My program is able to encrypt and decrypt messages by a given key/date or generate their own key and date and successfully control that output.

OOP - 3-2
  I have created a logical breakout of the for the engima machine in encryption decryption and a general control file. I was able to module out a majority of the the encrypt/decrypt classes and only have them actually contain their specific crypto methods.
  Initially these methods were below seven lines but they were increased beyond that to account for special characters.

TDD - 3
  I tried to build my project form the ground up as such I put a fair amount of thought into how the different methods could be broken out.
  As such I was testing individual pieces before I reached the combination. Then as I broke down my methods further I tested those parts as well to ensure they worked as expected.

Version Control - 3
  I made 11 pull requests and nearly 80 commits. Each commit was a small piece of the overall project and I believe I only lapsed once during the creation of the module.
  I actively committed in small chunks in part to ensure I was not building in the wrong direction and to ensure each piece actually worked as expected.
